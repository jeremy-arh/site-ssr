        },
        {
          question: 'Werden meine Dokumente offiziell international anerkannt?',
          answer: 'Ja. Alle über unsere Plattform notarisierten Dokumente können eine Apostille erhalten, die gemäß dem Haager Übereinkommen vom 5. Oktober 1961 ausgestellt wird. Diese Apostille bescheinigt die Authentizität der Unterschrift und des Siegels des Notars und gewährleistet die internationale Gültigkeit Ihres Dokuments in allen Mitgliedsländern.',

Videositzungen werden unter strenger Kontrolle aufgezeichnet und archiviert, um Integrität, Nachverfolgbarkeit und vollständige Vertraulichkeit für jede Notarisierung zu gewährleisten.',

        {
          question: 'Wann erhalte ich mein endgültiges Dokument?',
          answer: 'Unmittelbar nach dem Ende Ihrer Videositzung mit dem Notar ist Ihr notarisiertes Dokument automatisch in Ihrem sicheren Dashboard verfügbar. Sie erhalten Ihr notarisiertes Dokument sofort, ohne Verzögerung.

          answer: 'Das Haager Übereinkommen vom 5. Oktober 1961 ist ein internationales Abkommen, das die Authentifizierung öffentlicher Dokumente für die Verwendung im Ausland vereinfacht. Es etabliert eine standardisierte Form der Zertifizierung (Apostille), die von allen Mitgliedsländern anerkannt wird und die Notwendigkeit mehrerer Authentifizierungsebenen eliminiert.',

          question: 'Was ist der rechtliche Wert meiner Dokumente?',
          answer: 'Dokumente, die über unsere Plattform notarisiert wurden, haben den gleichen rechtlichen Wert wie traditionelle Notarisierungen.

Wir empfehlen jedoch die Verwendung eines Computers oder Tablets für die beste Erfahrung, insbesondere beim Anzeigen und Unterzeichnen von Dokumenten.',

Wir bieten auch beglaubigte Übersetzungsdienste an, um sicherzustellen, dass Ihre Dokumente alle Anforderungen erfüllen.',

        },
        {
          question: 'Was ist der Unterschied zwischen Zertifizierung und Apostille?',
          answer: 'Die Zertifizierung (Notarisierung) ist der Prozess, bei dem ein Notar Ihr Dokument überprüft und authentifiziert. Eine Apostille ist eine zusätzliche Zertifizierung, die die Unterschrift und das Siegel des Notars für die internationale Verwendung validiert. Die Apostille ist erforderlich, wenn Ihr Dokument in einem ausländischen Land verwendet werden muss, das Teil des Haager Übereinkommens ist.',

In den meisten Fällen können wir eine korrigierte Version oder zusätzliche Dokumentation ohne zusätzliche Kosten bereitstellen.

          answer: 'Tudo acontece em apenas alguns minutos, diretamente do seu navegador. Você agenda uma sessão de vídeo segura com um notário licenciado, assina seu documento remotamente e a notarização é concluída em tempo real. Seu documento notarizado é carregado imediatamente e disponível na plataforma, acompanhado de sua certificação digital.',
        },
        {
          question: 'Meus documentos são oficialmente reconhecidos internacionalmente?',
          answer: 'Sim. Todos os documentos notarizados através da nossa plataforma podem receber uma apostila emitida de acordo com a Convenção de Haia de 5 de outubro de 1961. Esta apostila certifica a autenticidade da assinatura e do selo do notário, garantindo a validade internacional do seu documento em todos os países membros.',
        },
        {
          question: 'Que tipos de documentos posso certificar?',
          answer: 'Você pode notarizar e certificar uma ampla gama de documentos, incluindo:\n- Contratos, declarações, declarações juramentadas e procurações simples\n- Cópias autenticadas (IDs, diplomas, certificados)\n- Traduções certificadas\n- Documentos comerciais e administrativos\nCada documento é assinado, selado e armazenado com segurança em seu espaço privado.',

          question: 'Como meus dados são protegidos?',
          answer: 'Todas as transferências são criptografadas de ponta a ponta (AES-256) e armazenadas em servidores seguros que cumprem os padrões internacionais de proteção de dados. As sessões de vídeo são gravadas e arquivadas sob controle rigoroso para garantir integridade, rastreabilidade e total confidencialidade para cada notarização.',
        },
        {
          question: 'Quando receberei meu documento final?',
          answer: 'Imediatamente após o fim da sua sessão de vídeo com o notário, seu documento notarizado está automaticamente disponível em seu painel seguro. Você recebe seu documento notarizado imediatamente, sem qualquer atraso. Se uma apostila for necessária, ela é adicionada uma vez validada pela autoridade competente — e o documento certificado final fica disponível para download instantâneo.',
        },
        {
          question: 'O que é a Convenção de Haia?',
          answer: 'A Convenção de Haia de 5 de outubro de 1961 é um tratado internacional que simplifica a autenticação de documentos públicos para uso no exterior. Estabelece uma forma padronizada de certificação (apostila) reconhecida por todos os países membros, eliminando a necessidade de múltiplos níveis de autenticação.',
        },
        {
          question: 'Qual é o valor legal dos meus documentos?',
          answer: 'Os documentos notarizados através da nossa plataforma têm o mesmo valor legal das notarizações tradicionais. São legalmente vinculativos, reconhecidos por tribunais, agências governamentais e instituições em todo o mundo, especialmente quando acompanhados de uma apostila para uso internacional.',

          question: 'O que preciso para a consulta de vídeo?',
          answer: 'Para sua consulta de vídeo, você precisará de:\n- Uma identidade oficial com foto válida (passaporte, carteira de motorista ou identidade nacional)\n- Uma conexão de internet estável\n- Um dispositivo com câmera e microfone (computador, tablet ou smartphone)\n- O documento original que deseja notarizar (se aplicável)\n- Um ambiente tranquilo e bem iluminado',

        },
        {
          question: 'E se meus documentos não estiverem em inglês?',
          answer: 'Podemos notarizar documentos em vários idiomas. No entanto, se seu documento precisar ser usado em um país de língua inglesa, você pode precisar de uma tradução certificada. Também fornecemos serviços de tradução certificada para garantir que seus documentos atendam a todos os requisitos.',

        {
          question: 'Meus documentos certificados serão aceitos para fins de imigração?',

          question: 'Vocês também fornecem serviços de apostila?',
          answer: 'Sim, fornecemos serviços completos de apostila. Uma vez que seu documento esteja notarizado, podemos obter a apostila da autoridade competente de acordo com a Convenção de Haia. A apostila geralmente é adicionada em 1-3 dias úteis após a notarização.',
        },
        {
          question: 'Qual é a diferença entre certificação e apostila?',
          answer: 'A certificação (notarização) é o processo pelo qual um tabelião verifica e autentica seu documento. Uma apostila é uma certificação adicional que valida a assinatura e o selo do tabelião para uso internacional. A apostila é necessária quando seu documento precisa ser usado em um país estrangeiro que faz parte da Convenção de Haia.',
        },
        {
          question: 'E se meu documento for rejeitado pela autoridade receptora?',
          answer: 'Se seu documento for rejeitado pela autoridade receptora, revisaremos o motivo da rejeição e trabalharemos com você para resolver o problema. Na maioria dos casos, podemos fornecer uma versão corrigida ou documentação adicional sem custo adicional. Se não pudermos resolver o problema, oferecemos uma garantia de reembolso completo.',
